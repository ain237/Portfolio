## 1. Introduction

Soccer match, like a match in any sports competition is an one-time performance faced with many uncertainties. On a bad day an excellent player will miss many goals, and some bad players might win out of pure luck. To understand the real performance of players, many soccer analysts have created models that are called xG-models, that vary in complexity. These models try to analyze the gameplay and come up with a numerical value of how many goals were expected from the game.

Complex xG models, such as one that we will use in this report, analyze complex data from the game, such as position on the map at certain time, and evaluate a chance for each shot of hitting the goal. When a xG model is accurate, it is much more useful to analyze the expected goals of a player or a team, rather than how many goals were scored during a match. The expected goals also predict the future performance very effectively compared to analyzing only the actual goals.

In this report we will present a xG model for analyzing the results of four European countries. The model will use complex data-analysis methods such as Logistic Regression, and will be trained using data from European soccer championships. The report will be accompanied by a Python-notebook, where the calculations are done. The data is sourced from a publicly available dataset.


## 2. Data Description
The dataset used in this report contains the following categories:  
* Competition data: European Championship
* Competition data: World Cup
* Country data for:
    * France
    * Germany
    * Italy
    * Spain

The data contains a set of shots during a game. The data was collected using cameras and manually inputted to the data file by human operators. Some of the data points were removed or converted during the data cleanup. For our analysis we will use the following information for a single shot:  
* X-coordinate
* Y-coordinate
* Whether feet or head was used (foot, head)

## 3. Creating a xG Model
### 3.1. Rationale

Following the example of a lecturer on Youtube (Friends of Tracking, 2020), we will use the distance of a player to the goal, as well as their visibility angle.

![Visibility angle of a player]({{"assets/xg-post/field_of_visibility.jpg" | relative_url }} "Figure 1: Visibility angle of a player ")
Figure 1: Visibility angle of a player. [(image source)](https://photostockeditor.com/image/football-soccer-player-making-goal-soccer-34841 "(image source)")

To help our algorithm to better predict the likelihood of shooting a goal, we will generate two additional variables:

1. Distance from goal

    The coordinate for the midpoint of the goal is (100,50)

    ![1st formula]({{"assets/xg-post/formula1.png" | relative_url }} " ")


2. Visibility angle
    The visibility angle is calculated using the formula for angle between two straight lines. The two straight lines are calculated from the location of the player to both ends of the goal area. The coordinates for goal endpoints are (100,53) and (100,47). The formulas for the calculation are:
 
    ![2nd formula]({{"assets/xg-post/formula2.png" | relative_url }} " ")


The calculated values in our Python-notebook can be seen from Table 1.

### 3.2. Model Building: Logistic Regression

For our xG model, we will use the L2 Logistic regression model with lbfgs-solver. According to Friends of Tracking (2020), Logistic regression is best suited for this type of problem, and we will thus not try other machine learning algorithms.
In order to see that our algorithm works well, we will attempt first to generate a dataset with only x,y coordinates plus the calculated values for degrees of visibility and distance, and not use any of the other variables for training the model. The model is trained with a split that uses 70% of the data for training the model, and 30% for testing.

Because of our limited data, and the nature of the sport, without rebalancing the data, the argorithm would predict the result to be almost always that the goal isn't made. Therefore we will rebalance the data. The whole dataset contained 31049 misses and 3578 goals. The data was rebalanced using majority downsampling where the total size of the data was 3578 goals and 3578 misses.

The first run with only x,y coordinates show the model to be 67.91% accurate. This seems sufficiently good considering we only have positional data for the predictions. To understand whether the model understands the game mechanics, we will generate a heatmap in top of an image of a soccer field that shows the spots with high probability for scoring.

![Figure 2]({{"assets/xg-post/soccerfield.png" | relative_url }} "Figure 2: Probability of scoring from a point in field.")
Figure 2: Probability of scoring from a point in field.


The heatmap in Figure 2 demonstrates that our model has successfully captured the mechanics of the game. We will continue by introducing the other variables foot and head to our algorithm. The new data is seen on Table 2.

    </tr>

### 3.3. Model Evaluation

After introducing the other variables to our algorithm, the modelâ€™s accuracy score stays the same at 67.91%. To further understand the model, we will calculate a confusion matrix, that intends to further explain, which predictions are accurate.


![Figure 3]({{"assets/xg-post/cfmatrix.png" | relative_url }}  "Figure 3: Confusion matrix")

The confusion matrix shows the model to be around 70% correct on both predicting goals and misses. It is somewhat skewed towards predicting goals, but we are satisfied with the accuracy considering that the model is built mainly on positional data. The model at this accuracy level may be slighlty useful for predicting results of games, but it is more useful for understanding the game mechanics and mapping the areas in which goal is likely to be made. This was seen in the heatmap we showed before. The heatmap shows that the model accurately understands the game mechanics.

## 4. Discussion and Conclusions
### 4.1. Evaluating the Performance of 4 European Countries Using Our xG Model

To show the usefulness of our xG model, we will compare the data from 4 European countries and their performance.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



![Figure 4]({{"assets/xg-post/countries.png" | relative_url }} "Figure 4: Bar plot comparison of the European countries.")

The performance of the European countries shown in Table 3 and Figure 4 shows the performance of each country. The results seem to be very skewed towards predicting goals, but they are still useful for evaluating the differences between the teams. Out of these countries both Germany and Spain seem to be at same level at around 42.5 expected goals, with Germany winning very slightly. Spain is followed by France and then Italy that performed worse in the expected goals as well as real performance.


### 4.2. Conclusions

The xG model we built using Logistic regression was found to be around 70% accurate for predicting goals, and it has useful real-life applications for evaluating team and player performance, and mapping the area in which the goal is likely to be made (Figure 2). This is useful information for training players. One training implication from this model is that the players should be instructed to shoot only from areas with for example above 50% chance of shooting a goal. In order to generate a more accurate model, more data would be needed. One example of this would be include more information about penalty kicks.
